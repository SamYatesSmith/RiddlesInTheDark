# Riddles in the Dark

## Introduction
Welcome to Riddles in the Dark.  Inspired by Bilbo and Gollum from the famous scene in The Hobbit where Bilbo must win a riddle game to ensure his survival and the promise of a route to escape the cave he's lost in.  Riddles in the Dark (*known henceforth as 'RITD') is a simple game which asks the players riddles and offers hints a word count in an attempt to aid players with their answers.  The game can be played by one or two players and encompassess a "lowest score wins" system. 

## Gameplay Overview
RITD combines classic riddle solving with innovative gameplay mechanics.  Players must answer x5 questions on their route to victory.  Furthermore, players must attempt to score the least amount of points possible in order to win.  The game offers the player the opportunity to take hints when they are unsure of the riddles solution.  These hints have a point penalty associated with them and therefore raise ones total score.  PLayers are also given a number of underscores ('_').  These are to advise the player how many letters the answer includes.  If a player get the riddle wrong at any point, regardless of hints taken, or if they make a mistake in the spelling of their answer (capitals not relevant) they will incur a points penalty.  Finally, if a player wants to skip a question altogether the player recieves a hefty 10 point fine to their total. 

The game, in addition to the 1 player game, the game offers the opportunity for a 2 player feature.  The 2 player game follows the same principles in terms of its rulings but alternates between the players, therefore the game will ask a total of 10 questions, 5 for each player. The 2 player game mode also has methodology for settling when the game ends in a tie.  This is in the form of a "sudden death" mode, wherethe first to get an incorrect answer, loses.
